# The Missing Tool for Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering has become one of the most critical skills in AI development, yet the tooling around it remains surprisingly primitive. Most teams manage prompts in spreadsheets, Notion docs, or scattered text files — with no version history, no testing framework, and no way to systematically compare prompt variations.

**Minions Prompts** brings the discipline of software engineering to prompt management.

<Callout type="info">
Think of Minions Prompts as "GitHub for prompts" — version control, branching, testing, and A/B comparison for your prompt engineering workflow.
</Callout>

## The Problem

When you're iterating on a prompt, you need to:

- **Track changes** — What did the prompt look like last week? What did I change?
- **Test systematically** — Does this prompt still handle edge cases after my edit?
- **Compare versions** — Is version 3 actually better than version 2?
- **Collaborate safely** — How do I let a teammate experiment without breaking production prompts?

Most teams solve this with copy-paste and naming conventions like `prompt_v3_final_FINAL.txt`. We can do better.

## How Minions Prompts Works

### Templates & Variables

Prompts are stored as templates with typed variables that are interpolated at runtime:

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from '@minions-prompts/sdk';

const template = new PromptTemplate({
  name: 'customer-support',
  content: 'You are a {{role}} helping a customer with {{issue}}. Respond in {{tone}} tone.',
  variables: {
    role: { type: 'string', default: 'support agent' },
    issue: { type: 'string', required: true },
    tone: { type: 'enum', values: ['professional', 'friendly', 'concise'] },
  },
});
```

### Version Chains

Every edit creates a new version linked to the previous one. You can traverse the full history, diff any two versions, and roll back to any point.

### Test-Driven Prompt Development

Write test cases for your prompts, just like you'd write unit tests for code:

```typescript
const testCase = {
  input: { issue: 'billing error', tone: 'professional' },
  assertions: [
    { type: 'contains', value: 'billing' },
    { type: 'max_tokens', value: 200 },
    { type: 'sentiment', value: 'positive' },
  ],
};
```

<Callout type="tip">
Test-driven prompt development catches regressions early. When you change a template, re-run your test suite to make sure all edge cases still pass.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

The `@minions-prompts/sdk` is available on NPM, along with a CLI tool and a web-based playground. We're actively developing the Python SDK and adding integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex.

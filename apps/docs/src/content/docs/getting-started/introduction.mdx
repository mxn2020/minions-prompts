## What is minions-prompts?

**minions-prompts** is a structured prompt engineering system built on the [Minions SDK](https://github.com/mxn2020/minions). It gives every prompt a full version history, a test suite, and measurable quality scores.

Think of it as **Git for your AI prompts** — every change is tracked, every version is comparable, and regressions are caught before they reach production.

## Who is it for?

- **Prompt engineers** who want version control without spreadsheets or ad-hoc naming conventions
- **AI teams** running systematic A/B tests across prompt variations
- **Developers** integrating prompts into CI/CD pipelines with automated testing
- **Agents** that self-improve by versioning their own system prompts

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Version History" icon="pencil">
    Every prompt change creates a new version linked via `follows` relations. Roll back, compare, or branch at any point.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variable Interpolation" icon="add-document">
    `{{variable}}`, `{{#if condition}}`, `{{#each items}}` — Handlebars-style templates with type safety.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test-Driven Development" icon="approve-check">
    Write test cases before changing prompts. Run them against old and new versions to catch regressions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="A/B Comparison" icon="setting">
    Run two versions against the same test suite and compare scores side by side.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

1. **Create** a prompt template with typed variables
2. **Version** it by creating linked variations via `follows` relations
3. **Test** each version against a shared test suite
4. **Compare** scores to pick the winner
5. **Export** to LangChain, LlamaIndex, or raw strings
